# Installer for the "Effective Shell" samples. If you are looking for the online
# book, just go to:
# 
#   https://effective-shell.com

# This script is used to allow a user to quickly download the samples for the
# 'effective shell' book on their local machine.
# 
# The goals of this script are:
# 
# - It *must* be secure - no need to run as 'sudo' and should not make any
#   sensitive changes to the machine.
# - It *must* be easy to use - a user can run `curl effective.sh | sh` to
#   install the samples.
# - It *must* be cross platform - users can use it on Linux, MacOS and WSL on
#   Windows and not require special software to be installed.
# - It *should* not interfere with any changes or work users have done with
#   with previous versions of the samples, so backups should be created.
# - It *should* be a good example of what an effective shell script looks like!
#
# Note that this script was inspired by NVM's installer:
#
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh
